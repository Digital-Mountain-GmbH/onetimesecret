# Onetime Secret - Secure One-Time Message Sharing

*Keep passwords and other sensitive information out of your inboxes and chat logs.*

## What is a Onetime Secret?

A onetime secret is a link that can be viewed only once. A single-use URL.

Try it out on [OnetimeSecret.com](https://onetimesecret.com/)!

### Why would I want to use it?

When you send people sensitive info like passwords and private links via email or chat, there are copies of that information stored in many places. If you use a Onetime link instead, the information persists for a single viewing which means it can't be read by someone else later. This allows you to send sensitive information in a safe way knowing it's seen by one person only. Think of it like a self-destructing message.

### Docker Installation

There are multiple ways to run OnetimeSecret using Docker. Choose the method that best suits your needs:

#### 1. Using Pre-built Images

We offer pre-built images on both GitHub Container Registry and Docker Hub.

```bash
# Pull from GitHub Container Registry
docker pull ghcr.io/onetimesecret/onetimesecret:latest

# OR, pull from Docker Hub
docker pull onetimesecret/onetimesecret:latest
```

#### 2. Building the Image Locally

If you prefer to build the image yourself:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/onetimesecret/onetimesecret.git
cd onetimesecret
docker build -t onetimesecret .
```

#### 3. Multi-platform Builds

For environments requiring multi-architecture support:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/onetimesecret/onetimesecret.git
cd onetimesecret
docker buildx build --platform=linux/amd64,linux/arm64 . -t onetimesecret
```

#### 4. Lite Docker Image

We also offer a "lite" version of the Docker image, which is optimized for quicker deployment and reduced resource usage. To use the lite version:

```bash
# Pull the lite image
docker pull ghcr.io/onetimesecret/onetimesecret:latest-lite

# OR, build it locally
docker build -f Dockerfile-lite -t onetimesecret:lite .
```

For more information on the lite Docker image, refer to the [DOCKER-lite.md](docs/DOCKER-lite.md) documentation.

### Running the Container

Regardless of how you obtained or built the image, follow these steps to run OnetimeSecret:

1. Start a Redis container:

   ```bash
   docker run -p 6379:6379 -d redis:bookworm
   ```

2. Set essential environment variables:

   ```bash
   export HOST=localhost:3000
   export SSL=false
   export COLONEL=admin@example.com
   export REDIS_URL=redis://host.docker.internal:6379/0
   export RACK_ENV=production
   ```

   Note: The `COLONEL` variable sets the admin account email. It's a playful combination of "colonel" (someone in charge) and "kernel" (as in Linux), representing the system administrator.

3. Run the OnetimeSecret container:

   ```bash
   docker run -p 3000:3000 -d --name onetimesecret \
     -e REDIS_URL=$REDIS_URL \
     -e COLONEL=$COLONEL \
     -e HOST=$HOST \
     -e SSL=$SSL \
     -e RACK_ENV=$RACK_ENV \
     onetimesecret/onetimesecret:latest
   ```

   Note: Replace `onetimesecret/onetimesecret:latest` with your image name if you built it locally.

OnetimeSecret should now be running and accessible at `http://localhost:3000`.

### Manual Installation

If you prefer to work with the source code directly, you can install OnetimeSecret manually. Follow these steps:

#### 1. Get the Code

Choose one of these methods:

* Download the [latest release](https://github.com/onetimesecret/onetimesecret/archive/refs/tags/latest.tar.gz)
* Clone the repository:

  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/onetimesecret/onetimesecret.git
  ```

#### 2. Install System Dependencies

2. Install [Ruby 3.1+](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/) and [bundler 2.5*](https://bundler.io/)
3. Install [Node.js 20+](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and [pnpm 9.2+](https://pnpm.io/installation)
4. Install additional required packages: build-essential, libyaml-dev, libffi-dev

For Debian/Ubuntu systems, you can use the following commands:

```bash
# Update package list and install basic dependencies
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y git redis-server build-essential libyaml-dev libffi-dev

# Install Ruby 3.1
sudo apt install -y ruby3.1 ruby3.1-dev

# Install Node.js and pnpm
curl -fsSL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_22.x | sudo -E bash -
sudo apt install -y nodejs
sudo npm install -g pnpm@latest
```

Note: After installation, make sure Redis is running with `service redis-server status`. Start it if needed with `service redis-server start`.

For other operating systems, please refer to the official documentation for each dependency to install the correct versions.

#### 3. Initialize the config files

```bash
cd onetimesecret
git rev-parse --short HEAD > .commit_hash.txt
cp --preserve --no-clobber ./etc/config.example.yaml ./etc/config.yaml
```

#### 4. Install Ruby Dependencies

```bash
sudo gem install bundler
bundle config set --local without 'development test'
bundle update --bundler
bundle install
```

#### 5. Install JavaScript Dependencies

```bash
pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
```

#### 6. Build the Frontend

```bash
pnpm run build
```


#### 7. Run the Web Application

There are two main ways to run the application, depending on your development needs:

##### Option A: Without Vite Dev Server (Production-like or Simple Development)

1. For production or simple development without frontend changes:

   ```bash
   RACK_ENV=production bundle exec thin -R config.ru -p 3000 start
   ```

   Or, for a development environment with a static frontend and Ruby live reloading:

   ```bash
   RACK_ENV=development bundle exec thin -R config.ru -p 3000 start
   ```

   Ensure `development.enabled` is set to `false` in `etc/config.yaml`:

   ```yaml
   :development:
     :enabled: false
   ```

   This uses pre-built frontend assets in the `dist/assets` directory.

##### Option B: With Vite Dev Server (Active Frontend Development)

1. Set `development.enabled` to `true` in `etc/config.yaml`:

   ```yaml
   :development:
     :enabled: true
   ```

2. Run the Thin server in development mode:

   ```bash
   RACK_ENV=development bundle exec thin -R config.ru -p 3000 start
   ```

3. In a separate terminal, start the Vite dev server:

   ```bash
   pnpm run dev
   ```

   This enables live reloading of frontend assets.

The application determines whether to use development or production assets based on the `development.enabled` setting. In development mode with the Vite server running, frontend assets are loaded dynamically:

```html
{{#frontend_development}}
<script type="module" src="{{ frontend_host }}/dist/main.ts"></script>
<script type="module" src="{{ frontend_host }}/dist/@vite/client"></script>
{{/frontend_development}}
```

In production mode, it uses the built files in `dist/assets`:

```html
{{^frontend_development}}
{{{vite_assets}}}
{{/frontend_development}}
```

Choose the option that best fits your development workflow and needs.

## Configuration

OnetimeSecret requires a `config.yaml` file for all installations. Environment variables can be used to override specific settings, but the `config.yaml` file must always be present.

### Basic Setup

1. Create the configuration file:

   ```bash
   cp --preserve --no-clobber ./etc/config.example.yaml ./etc/config.yaml
   ```

2. Review and edit `./etc/config.yaml` as needed. At minimum, update the secret key and back it up securely.

### Configuration Options

#### 1. Using config.yaml (Required)

The `./etc/config.yaml` file is the primary configuration method. It uses ERB syntax to incorporate environment variables, allowing for flexible configuration:

```yaml
---
:site:
  :host: <%= ENV['HOST'] || 'localhost:7143' %>
:domains:
  :enabled: <%= ENV['DOMAINS_ENABLED'] || false %>
```

In this format:

* If an environment variable (e.g., `HOST`) is set, its value will be used.
* If the environment variable is not set, the fallback value (e.g., 'localhost:7143') will be used.
* If you remove the ERB syntax and environment variable reference, only the literal value in the config will be used.

Key areas to configure in `config.yaml`:

* SMTP or SendGrid for email
* Redis connection details
* Rate limits
* Enabled locales

#### 2. Using Environment Variables (Optional)

For quick setups or container deployments, you can use environment variables to override `config.yaml` settings:

```bash
export HOST=localhost:3000
export SSL=false
export COLONEL=admin@example.com
export REDIS_URL=redis://username:password@hostname:6379/0
export RACK_ENV=production
```

#### 3. Using a .env File (Optional)

For various deployment scenarios, including Docker setups and local development, you can use a `.env` file to set environment variables:

1. Create the .env file:

   ```bash
   cp --preserve --no-clobber .env.example .env
   ```

2. Edit the `.env` file with your desired configuration.

3. Usage depends on your setup:
   * For local development, load the variables before running the application:

     ```bash
     set -a
     source .env
     set +a
     ```

   * For Docker deployments, you can use the `--env-file` option:

     ```bash
     docker run --env-file .env your-image-name
     ```

   * In docker-compose, you can specify the .env file in your docker-compose.yml:

     ```yaml
     services:
       your-service:
         env_file:
           - .env
     ```

The .env file is versatile and can be used in various deployment scenarios, offering flexibility in how you manage your environment variables.

### Important Notes

* The `config.yaml` file is always required, even when using environment variables.
* Choose either direct environment variables or the `.env` file method, but not both, to avoid confusion.
* If you remove environment variable references from `config.yaml`, only the literal values in the config will be used.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Use a secure value for the `SECRET` key as an environment variable or as `site.secret` in `etc/config.yaml`. Once set, do not change this value. Create and store a backup in a secure offsite location. Changing the secret may prevent decryption of existing secrets.

For a full list of available configuration options, refer to the comments in the `config.example.yaml` file.

### Generating a Secure Random Key

To generate a secure, random 256-bit (32-byte) secret key, you can use the following command with OpenSSL:

```bash
openssl rand -hex 32
```

If OpenSSL is not installed, you can use the `dd` command as a fallback:

```bash
dd if=/dev/urandom bs=32 count=1 2>/dev/null | xxd -p -c 32
```

Note: While the `dd` command provides a reasonable alternative, using OpenSSL is recommended for cryptographic purposes.

## Miscellaneous

### Docker-related Tips

#### Container Name Already in Use

If you encounter the error "The container name '/onetimesecret' is already in use":

```bash
# If the container already exists, you can simply start it again:
docker start onetimesecret

# OR, remove the existing container
docker rm onetimesecret
```

After removing the container, you can run the regular `docker run` command again.

#### Docker Compose

For Docker Compose setup, see the dedicated [Docker Compose repo](https://github.com/onetimesecret/docker-compose/).

### Development Tips

#### Debugging

To run in debug mode:

```bash
ONETIME_DEBUG=true bundle exec thin -e dev start
```

#### Front-end Development

When running the Vite server in development mode, it will automatically reload when files change. Ensure that `RACK_ENV` is set to `development` or `development.enabled` in `etc/config` is set to `false`.

#### Setting up pre-commit hooks

We use the `pre-commit` framework to maintain code quality. To set it up:

1. Install pre-commit:

   ```bash
   pip install pre-commit
   ```

2. Install the git hooks:

   ```bash
   pre-commit install
   ```

This will ensure that the pre-commit hooks run before each commit, helping to maintain code quality and consistency.

##### Optimizing Docker Builds

To see the layers of an image and optimize your builds, use:

```bash
docker history <image_id>
```

### Production Deployment

When deploying to production, ensure you:

1. Protect your Redis instance with authentication or Redis networks.
2. Enable Redis persistence and save the data securely.
3. Change the secret to a strong, unique value.
4. Specify the correct domain it will be deployed on.

Example production deployment:

```bash
export HOST=example.com
export SSL=true
export COLONEL=admin@example.com
export REDIS_URL=redis://username:password@hostname:6379/0
export RACK_ENV=production

docker run -p 3000:3000 -d --name onetimesecret \
  -e REDIS_URL=$REDIS_URL \
  -e COLONEL=$COLONEL \
  -e HOST=$HOST \
  -e SSL=$SSL \
  -e RACK_ENV=$RACK_ENV \
  onetimesecret
```

Ensure all sensitive information is properly secured and not exposed in your deployment scripts or environment.
